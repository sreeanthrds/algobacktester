# algobacktester
To build the **Algobacktester** application from a backend-first perspective, you need to design the system around a solid API architecture. This means creating an API-driven backend that can handle strategy creation, backtesting, indicator calculations, trade executions, and monitoring. Later, the UI will use these APIs to provide a user interface for your stakeholders.

### Key Steps for Building the Backend:

---

### **1. Define the System Architecture**
Design a **3-tier architecture** where the frontend (UI) interacts with the backend through well-defined RESTful APIs. Here's an overview:

1. **Frontend/UI**: This will be built later but will consume the APIs.
2. **Backend (API Server)**: This will handle all the logic for strategies, backtesting, and data processing. Built with Python (Django/Flask), Node.js, or a similar web framework.
3. **Database Layer**: Store user data, strategy definitions, backtest results, and historical market data.

---

### **2. API Design and Structure**
Design the APIs to handle all the key functions needed for building and executing trading strategies. Here's a breakdown of the core API endpoints.

#### **API Endpoints to Create**

1. **Authentication and User Management**:
   - `POST /auth/register`: User registration.
   - `POST /auth/login`: User login and token generation.
   - `GET /auth/logout`: Log the user out.
   - **Required Data**: Email, password, user profile info.
   - **Response**: JWT token for subsequent requests.

2. **Strategy Management APIs**:
   - **POST /strategies**: Create a new trading strategy.
     - **Input**: Name, description, list of nodes (entry/exit/condition/loop), and conditions.
     - **Output**: Strategy ID and confirmation.
   - **GET /strategies**: Get all strategies for a user.
     - **Output**: List of strategies.
   - **GET /strategies/{strategyId}**: Get details of a specific strategy.
   - **PUT /strategies/{strategyId}**: Update an existing strategy.
   - **DELETE /strategies/{strategyId}**: Delete a strategy.

3. **Indicator Management**:
   - **GET /indicators**: List available indicators (e.g., EMA, SMA, RSI).
   - **POST /strategies/{strategyId}/indicators**: Add an indicator node to the strategy.
     - **Input**: Indicator type (EMA), period (e.g., 20), time frame (e.g., 1 hour).
     - **Output**: Indicator ID.

4. **Condition and Logic APIs**:
   - **POST /strategies/{strategyId}/conditions**: Add conditional logic (e.g., "If 20 EMA crosses 50 EMA").
     - **Input**: Condition (crosses above, crosses below, etc.).
     - **Output**: Condition ID.

5. **Backtesting and Execution APIs**:
   - **POST /backtest**: Run backtesting for a specific strategy.
     - **Input**: Strategy ID, time range (start and end date), market data inputs.
     - **Output**: List of trades, performance metrics (win rate, profit/loss, etc.).
   - **GET /backtest/{backtestId}**: Retrieve results of a specific backtest.

6. **Trade Execution APIs**:
   - **POST /trades/execute**: Execute a trade (Buy/Sell) based on a strategy.
     - **Input**: Strategy ID, trade type (buy/sell), asset (option, stock), and volume.
     - **Output**: Trade confirmation (Trade ID, executed price).
   - **GET /trades/{tradeId}**: Get details of a specific trade.

7. **Notification and Alerts**:
   - **POST /notifications/alerts**: Send alerts or notifications based on strategy triggers (e.g., exit condition met).
   - **GET /notifications/history**: Retrieve alert history.

### **3. Choose a Technology Stack for the Backend**
To build a scalable and robust backend, here are some technology options:

#### **Backend Framework**:
- **Python (Django/Flask)**: Python is great for developing financial applications, and Django/Flask provides a strong framework for building REST APIs.
  - **Why**: Python has great libraries for working with financial data (Pandas, NumPy), making it ideal for implementing complex strategies and indicators.
- **Node.js (Express)**: For a highly scalable, event-driven architecture, Node.js is ideal for real-time applications.
  - **Why**: JavaScript is fast and lightweight for API services, and you can scale it easily.

#### **Database**:
- **Relational DB (PostgreSQL/MySQL)**: To store structured data such as user info, strategies, and trade logs.
- **NoSQL (MongoDB)**: To handle flexible data models for strategies or historical data with varied structures.

#### **Other Components**:
- **Redis**: For caching real-time data (e.g., live market data) or user sessions.
- **Celery/RabbitMQ**: For handling background tasks like running backtests asynchronously without blocking the main API.
- **Docker**: Containerize the entire application to easily scale and manage microservices.

---

### **4. Implement Core Functionalities**

#### **a. Strategy Storage and Execution**
- Store strategies in the database, each consisting of:
  - **Nodes** (Entry, Exit, Condition, Action).
  - **Node Types**: Each node can be a condition, loop, or action (buy, sell, wait).
  - **Connections**: Define how nodes are connected (e.g., if EMA crosses above, buy; else hold).

#### **b. Indicator Calculations**
- Implement indicator logic using libraries like **TA-Lib** or custom scripts using **Pandas**:
  - **20 EMA, 50 EMA**: Calculate Exponential Moving Averages using historical price data.
  - Other indicators (MACD, RSI) can be implemented similarly.

#### **c. Backtesting Logic**
- When users run a backtest:
  - Fetch historical data from your data source (e.g., **Yahoo Finance**, **Alpaca API**, **Quandl**).
  - Process the data through the defined strategy logic.
  - Store the backtest results (trades, performance metrics).
  
#### **d. Trade Execution**
- Integrate with broker APIs (e.g., **Interactive Brokers API**, **Alpaca API**) to place real trades when strategies trigger buy/sell conditions.

#### **e. Notifications**
- Use **Twilio** or **SendGrid** for sending alerts (via SMS or email) when certain strategy conditions are met.

---

### **5. Set Up Testing and Deployment**
- **Automated Testing**: Use testing frameworks like **PyTest** (Python) or **Jest** (Node.js) to ensure that each API endpoint and function behaves as expected.
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Set up CI pipelines (e.g., with GitHub Actions or Jenkins) to automatically test and deploy your code.
- **Containerization**: Use **Docker** to containerize your services for easy deployment and scaling.

---

### Example Workflow for Strategy Creation:

1. **Step 1**: User creates a strategy via `POST /strategies` and sets the entry condition (e.g., "If 20 EMA crosses above 50 EMA").
2. **Step 2**: User adds an action to the strategy via `POST /strategies/{strategyId}/actions` (e.g., "Sell Put at ATM").
3. **Step 3**: User runs a backtest via `POST /backtest`, where historical data is fetched, indicators are calculated, and trades are simulated.
4. **Step 4**: User views backtest results via `GET /backtest/{backtestId}`.

By building out the backend and exposing these APIs, you can create a flexible, scalable system that can later be integrated with a front-end interface for easy strategy building and execution. This API-driven approach ensures you can develop in stages, focusing on core functionality first. Let me know if you need further details or clarifications!
